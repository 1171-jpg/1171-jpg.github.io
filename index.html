    <h1>SemEval 2024 Task: Emotion Discovery and Reasoning its Flip in Conversation (EDiReF)</h1>
    <a href="#">Task Home Page</a>
    <p>The EDiReF shared task at SemEval 2024 is an amalgamation of three subtasks tasks- 
        (i) Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) in Hindi-English code-mixed conversations, 
        (ii) Emotion Flip Reasoning (EFR) in Hindi-English code-mixed conversations, and 
        (iii) EFR in English conversations. The definition for the tasks of ERC and EFR are as illustrated below:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>ERC: Given a dialogue, ERC aims to assign an emotion to each utterance from a predefined set of possible emotions.</li>
        <li>EFR: Given a dialogue, EFR aims to identify the trigger utterance(s) for an emotion-flip in a multi-party conversation dialogue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Task Example</h2>
    <p>For example, given a sample dialogue below:</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Speaker</th>
                <th>Utterance</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Sp1</td>
                <td>I had an awful day today!</td>
            </tr>
            <!-- Include other rows here -->
        </tbody>
    </table>
