        <a href="#">Task Home Page</a>
    </header>

    <p>BRAINTEASER QA task consists of two subtasks-<strong>Reverse Thinking</strong> and <strong>Word Play</strong> that require awareness of commonsense “defaults” and overwriting them through  unconventional thinking that distinguishes these defaults from hard constraints.
    
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reverse Thinking</strong>: Sentence-type brain teaser requires systems to defy commonsense assoications and think out of box.</li>
        <li><strong>Word Play</strong>: Word-type brain teaser requires systems to discard the semantic meaning of the question or answer but pay attention in a literal way.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Both tasks include an adversarial subset, created by manually modifying the original brain teasers without changing their latent reasoning path.</p>

    <h2>Task Example</h2>
    <p>Here are two examples from each subtasks</p>
    <table align="center">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Question</th>
                <th>Choice</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>A man shaves everyday, yet keeps his beard long.</td>
                <td>
                    <strong>He is a barber.</strong><hr>
                    He wants to maintain his appearance.<hr>
                    He wants his girlfriend to buy him a razor.<hr>
                    None of the above.<hr>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="2"><hr></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>What part of London is in France?</td>
                <td>
                    <strong>The letter N.</strong><hr>
                    The letter O.<hr>

                    None of the above.<hr>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    <p>To ensure that our task evaluates reasoning ability rather than memorization, we construct adversarial versions of
        the original data in two ways: </p>
        
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Semantic Reconstruction</strong> rephrases the original question
    without changing the correct answer and the distractors.</li>
        <li> <strong>Context Reconstruction</strong> keeps the 
    original reasoning path but changes both the question and the answer to describe a new situational context. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here are one example of two adversarial versions of reverser thinking </p>

    <p>Each system will be evaluated based on the following two accuracy metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Instance-based Accuracy</strong>: We considers each question (original/adversarial) as a separate instance. We will report accuracy for the original, and its adversarials.</li>
        <li> <strong>Group-based Accuracy</strong>: Each question and its associated adversarial instances form a group, and a system will only receive a score of 1 when it correctly solves all questions in the group.</li>
    </ul>
